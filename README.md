Most sports teams already use statistical data to support their game plans going into big
games to pinpoint areas of strengths and weaknesses. They also use data analytics to scout their
opponents to prepare the team for whatever is about to come their way. The main problem,
though, is how this data is visualized for coaches and players. Management, coaches, and players
donâ€™t have the time and energy to listen to random statistical methods and numbers but would
rather have the information laid out in front of them so they know the bottom line of what they
need to do. This is especially important in the NBA where there is an immense amount of data
available from each player, for each stat, for each season, and from each team. By focusing on
presenting the information in a digestible format, the players and coaches can focus on the task at
hand - winning their games. Our focus is on the Milwaukee Bucks, and our goal is to help them
develop strategies and pinpoint areas of interest to focus on in the future.
Our solution to this data visualization problem is to focus on a select few important
statistics to give the team a starting point in their game planning. Our main goals were to:

1. Identify which players are overperforming or underperforming on the Bucks
2. Identify trends in offensive and defensive performances of opponents
3. Highlight areas for improvement
   
Focusing on these goals will allow our team to both prepare for upcoming games as well as get
insight into their own game. Since there are so many statistics in basketball, as well as large
rosters, there is a challenge in how to make these visualizations concise and understandable to
everyone. With these goals in mind, we narrowed down the areas of focus on our datasets to
Offensive/Defensive Rating and Individual player shooting and efficiency statistics. Our job is to
simplify complex data so that it is understandable and easy to act on. By doing this, we can help
the Bucks improve their game plans and perform better on the court.
